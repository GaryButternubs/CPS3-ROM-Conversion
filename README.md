# CPS3-ROM-Conversion
A simple, poorly coded tool to convert Combined CPS3 ROMs (ie. those with files 10, 20, 30, etc.) into Split CPS3 ROMs (ie. those with files simm1.0, simm1.1, etc.), and vice versa. All CPS3 games are supported, being the Street Fighter 3 series (New Generation, Second Impact, and Third Strike), the JoJo's series (Venture and Heritage for the Future), and Red Earth.

How To Use
Most of the intstructions are told during execution of the program. Just note that in order to run such, you must extract the .zip containing the version of the game you wish to convert into a folder. You must also choose a destination folder for the newly converted files to go to, making sure that there isn't already versions of that type of file there, as, otherwise, the program will either overwrite such, or just not work properly (I likely should've tested it, but I am remarkably lazy and a fair bit apathetic.)

Also note that, since this is a .jar file, you will need either the Java Runtime Environment, or have Java downloaded in some capacity, if that's the correct term for it (apologies to anyone that actually knows what they are doing, I am sorry to say I do not.)
