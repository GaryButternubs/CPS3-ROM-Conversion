# JoJoban-ROM-Conversion
A simple, poorly coded tool to convert Combined JoJoban ROMs (ie. those with files 10, 20, 30, etc.) into Split JoJoban ROMs (ie. those with files jojoba-simm1.0, jojoba-simm1.1, etc.), and vice versa.

How To Use
Most of the intstructions are told during execution of the program. Just note that in order to run such, you must extract the .zip containing the version of JoJoban you wish to convert into a folder. You must also choose a destination folder for the newly converted files to go to, making sure that there isn't already versions of that type of file there, as, otherwise, the program will either overwrite such, or just not work properly (I likely should've tested it, but I am remarkably lazy and a fair bit apathetic.)

Also note that, since this is a .jar file, you will need either the Java Runtime Environment, or have Java downloaded in some capacity, if that's the correct term for it (apologies to anyone that actually knows what they are doing, I am sorry to say I do not.)

One final thing to mention is that, until RedGGPO supports ROMs with incorrect checksums (meaning that ROM can be altered and the game will still run properly), this can only be used for Final Burn Neo, and cannot for RedGGPO or GGPOFBN. As soon as support is added, I will go ahead and remove this small segment. This is simply a temporary disclaimer.
